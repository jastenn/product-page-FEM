## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) - React Helper Function for better UX
- [Headless UI React](https://headlessui.dev/) - React Component Library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind css](tailwindcss.com) - CSS utility classes
- [React Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) - Swiper Component Library

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned to use Swiper js and have a comprehensive understanding on Tailwind css with its primary concepts. I also discovered and learned React aria that helps you build accessible and provide a better ux

### Continued development

I will continue to use tailwind css as it provides better dx and to dive deeper on Web Accessibility concepts.

### Useful resources

- [Swiper js Demos](https://swiperjs.com/demos) - This helps me to implement swiper with react as it provides a lot of demos with different modules.
